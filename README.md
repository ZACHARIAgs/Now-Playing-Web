# Spotify Now Playing Display

A beautifully responsive, lightweight, and hardware-accelerated "Now Playing" web application for Spotify.

## Just go to https://zachariags.github.io/Now-Playing-Web/

This project was built to transform any unused screen into a cool music display. By running entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with no backend required, it's incredibly portable. Whether you're displaying it on a secondary PC monitor, mounting an old iPad on the wall, or converting a dusty Kindle, this app is great. 

### Features
**Immersive UI:** A full-screen, blurred, and rotating background that adapts to the current album art.  
**Potato Ready:** The animations are optimized using GPU hardware acceleration (`translate3d`), meaning it respects battery life even on old hardware.  
**Fully Responsive:** Custom portrait and landscape layout modes. When standing up, the UI stacks vertically. When in landscape, it spreads out horizontally.  

### Running on an old Android Tablet
This project was originally built explicitly to give an old Amazon Kindle Fire 7 a second life! 
If you want to use it as an always-on dashboard on a tablet:
1. Download a kiosk application onto your tablet (such as **Fully Kiosk Browser**).
2. Set the "Start URL" to `zachariags.github.io/Now-Playing-Web`
3. Connect to your Spotify account, and lock it into full-screen mode!

*Note: If using an older Kindle or Android device with an outdated certificate store, be sure to use Cloudflare Pages or enable "Ignore SSL Errors" in your Kiosk browser settings to ensure a smooth connection!*
